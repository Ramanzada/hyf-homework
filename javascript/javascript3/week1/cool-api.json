/*One cool API that I found is the NASA API (https://api.nasa.gov/).
This API provides access to NASA's data, including information on Mars, Earth, and outer space. 
You can use it to retrieve images, videos, and other information about NASA's missions, as well as 
information about current and past space events. The API requires an API key, which you can get by 
registering on the NASA API website.
The NASA API responds with JSON data, which is structured as an object. The structure of the data may 
vary depending on the endpoint you're accessing, but it generally includes information about the data returned, 
such as the title, description, and date of the information. For example, when you query the API to get the latest 
image of Mars, the response will be something like this:*/

    "explanation": "Why is the sky blue? Because of Rayleigh scattering. As light from the sun travels 
    through the atmosphere, it is scattered in all directions by the gases and tiny particles, like oxygen 
    and nitrogen molecules. This scattered light is what makes the sky blue. The same process can also make 
    the sky yellow, orange, or even red, depending on the size and composition of the scattering particles 
    and the angle of the sun. The featured image was taken last month from the top of a mountain in the Pyrenees, 
    France, and shows a blue sky with thin clouds above a colorful landscape. The thin clouds are made of water 
    droplets that scatter sunlight in a similar way. The sun is also visible on the horizon, casting a warm golden 
    light on the landscape.",
